## My attempt at making an IRS tax/witholings calculator in rust because i was annoyed this wasnt such a basic and trivial math/excel formula that I could blast into a simple webpage but nothing worked for me


it uses egui and other cool rust tools to render stuff,
make sure you have some of the libs to run wayland,
`apt install libwayland-egl1`
and i also just install gimp which brings in tons of default linux rendering libraries that you'll probably also need
`apt install gimp`
